# Week 11: Portfolio & Case Studies

## 🎯 Objectives

- Produce concise case studies and artifacts that demonstrate architectural decisions, implementation, and outcomes.
- Prepare material for interviews and stakeholder presentations.

## 📚 Learning Topics

- Writing effective case studies: problem, constraints, solution, results, and trade-offs.
- Diagramming (C4, sequence diagrams) and ADR consolidation.
- Packaging demos and reproducible steps for reviewers.

## 🛠 Hands-on Tasks (copyable steps)

1. Select 2–3 projects to document

- Examples: AKS reference architecture, hybrid microservices checkout flow, multi-region failover.

2. For each project, produce artifacts

- C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams, ADRs, deployment manifests, and a short demo script.

3. Write the case study

- Use a template: Context → Challenge → Solution → Impact → Lessons Learned.

4. Create a portfolio site or README

- Collate case studies into `portfolio/` or publish via GitHub Pages.

## 🏗 Deliverables

- 2–3 detailed case studies in `projects/` with diagrams and ADRs.
- Portfolio README with links to demos, diagrams, and code.
- Demo scripts and sample data to run demos locally or in a sandbox environment.

## 🔍 Architecture Diagrams (placeholder)

- `cloud-architect-roadmap/diagrams/portfolio-casestudies.png` — visual summary of selected case studies.

## 📓 Notes & Reflection (TMS perspective)

Artifacts are proof of practice. Week 11 is where I focus on telling the story: why we made decisions, what we measured, and what changed as a result. Concise metrics (latency improvement, cost savings) make case studies persuasive.
