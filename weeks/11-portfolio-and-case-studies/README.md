# Week 11: Portfolio & Case Studies

## 🎯 Objectives

- Produce polished case studies and artifacts that showcase architecture decisions, implementations, and measurable outcomes.
- Prepare materials suitable for recruiters and interviewers (concise, evidence-based).

## 📚 Learning Topics

- Case study structure: Context → Problem → Solution → Impact → Lessons.
- Diagram polish and storytelling: C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams, and metrics.
- Packaging demos and reproducible environments.

## 🛠 Hands-on Tasks (copyable steps)

1. Select case studies

- Choose 2–3 projects (e.g., AKS reference, hybrid checkout, multi-region failover).

2. Produce artifacts

- Create clean diagrams, ADRs, deployment manifests, and a demo script for each case study.

3. Build portfolio README or GitHub Pages

- Summarize each case study with links to diagrams, code, and a short video demo if possible.

4. Integrate into resume

- Add a one-line summary and link to each case study in your resume or LinkedIn.

## 🏗 Deliverables

- 2–3 complete case studies with diagrams and ADRs in `projects/`.
- Portfolio README or site to showcase projects.
- Demo scripts and sample data for reviewers to run.

## 📓 Notes & Reflection (TMS perspective)

Week 11 is about turning hard work into evidence. I focus on succinct storytelling: what problem I solved, what constraints existed, what I chose, and what measurable improvement resulted.
