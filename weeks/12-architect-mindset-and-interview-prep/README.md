# Week 12: Architect Mindset & Interview Prep

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice system design and behavioral interview skills; codify trade-off thinking and communication patterns.
- Consolidate learning into a repeatable interview prep routine.

## 📚 Learning Topics

- Azure Well-Architected Framework and its pillars.
- System design interview patterns: capacity planning, data partitioning, consistency models, caching.
- Mock interviews, whiteboarding, and the STAR method for behavioral questions.
- Documenting trade-offs and improving articulation skills.

## 🛠 Hands-on Tasks (copyable steps)

1. Study Well-Architected Framework

- Read and summarize the five pillars and map them to your projects.

2. System design drills

- Practice 2–3 timed system design prompts per day and record solutions.

3. Behavioral stories (STAR)

- Prepare 6–8 STAR stories and refine them with peer feedback.

4. Mock interviews

- Schedule mock interviews with peers or use online platforms for feedback and recording.

## 🏗 Deliverables

- Interview notes, system design templates, and recorded mock interview sessions.
- A personal cheatsheet mapping common patterns to Azure services.

## 📓 Notes & Reflection (TMS perspective)

Week 12 is where you learn to tell your story. For me, clarity and brevity are valuable: present assumptions, list trade-offs, and propose a pragmatic design. Practice is the only way to make trade-off narration smooth under time pressure.
