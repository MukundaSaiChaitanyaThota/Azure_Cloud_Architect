# Week 12: Architect Mindset & Interview Prep

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop communication and problem-solving skills required for cloud architecture roles and stakeholder leadership.
- Prepare for system design interviews and articulate trade-offs clearly.

## 📚 Learning Topics

- Storytelling in architecture: presenting context, constraints, decisions, and outcomes.
- System design interview patterns: capacity planning, failure modes, consistency/availability trade-offs.
- Behavioral interview prep (STAR method) and whiteboard techniques.
- Continuous learning plan and next steps beyond the 3-month roadmap.

## 🛠 Hands-on Tasks (copyable steps)

1. Practice system design prompts

- Use a template to sketch solutions: requirements, scale, components, data flow, and trade-offs.

2. Prepare STAR stories for key experiences

- Write 6–8 stories that demonstrate leadership, conflict resolution, trade-off decisions, and impact.

3. Whiteboard practice and mock interviews

- Pair with a peer or use online platforms to simulate architecture interviews.

4. Consolidate portfolio and talking points

- Prepare a 10–15 minute demo for each case study focusing on decisions and outcomes.

## 🏗 Deliverables

- Interview notes, system design templates, and STAR stories saved in `docs/notes/`.
- A 10–15 minute demo script per case study.
- A continuous learning plan for the next 6 months.

## 📓 Notes & Reflection (TMS perspective)

Week 12 is about clarity and communication. For TMS, being able to explain trade-offs succinctly and show measurable outcomes is key. Practice, feedback, and iterating on your explanations refine both thinking and presentation skills.
