Week 11: Portfolio & Case Studies

🎯 Objectives

- Build real-world case studies and a portfolio of deliverables to demonstrate architecture decisions and implementations.
- Document lessons learned, trade-offs, and measurable outcomes.

📚 Learning Topics

- Creating architecture artifacts: C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams, ADRs.
- Writing case studies with metrics and outcomes.
- Presenting portfolios for interviews and stakeholder reviews.

🛠 Hands-on Tasks (Step-by-step)

1. Choose Case Studies
   - Select 2-3 projects (e.g., e-commerce platform, data ingestion pipeline) to document end-to-end.

2. Document Architecture
   - Produce C4 diagrams, ADRs, and deployment runbooks for each case study.

3. Measure Outcomes
   - Collect metrics: latency, cost, availability before/after changes and record results.

4. Portfolio Site
   - Create a simple portfolio site or GitHub Pages to showcase the projects.

🏗 Deliverables

- Case study documents, diagrams, and ADRs.
- Portfolio README with links to demos and code.

📓 Notes & Reflection (TMS perspective)

Artifacts are proof of capability. Week 11 focused on distilling work into concise case studies that highlight decision-making and impact.
