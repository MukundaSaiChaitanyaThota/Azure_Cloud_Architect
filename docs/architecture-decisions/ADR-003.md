ADR-003: Use Terraform modules with remote state in Azure Storage

Context

Infrastructure must be provisioned in a repeatable, auditable way. Team members will collaborate on modules and manage state securely.

Decision

Adopt Terraform modules for reusable infrastructure components and use Azure Storage Account as the remote backend with container locking for state. Enforce state access control via Azure RBAC and limit write access to CI service principals.

Alternatives

- Use Terraform Cloud/Enterprise for remote state and policy enforcement.
- Use local state with manual coordination (not recommended).

Trade-offs

- Azure Storage backend is cost-effective and simple to manage but lacks the policy and governance features of Terraform Cloud.
- Terraform Cloud adds features (sentinel, workspace management) at an additional cost.

Status

Accepted
