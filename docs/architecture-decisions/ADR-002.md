ADR-002: Adopt ArgoCD for GitOps deployments

Context

We need a declarative, auditable, and automated continuous delivery approach for Kubernetes workloads across multiple clusters and environments. The solution should support progressive delivery, rollbacks, and reduce manual intervention.

Decision

Adopt ArgoCD as the primary GitOps controller for continuous delivery of Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts. ArgoCD will run in a small management cluster and synchronize application manifests from Git repositories to target AKS clusters.

Alternatives

- FluxCD: Lightweight GitOps controller with strong automation and image automation features.
- Jenkins/X or Tekton with custom CD pipelines: More flexible but increases operational complexity.
- Custom GitHub Actions to apply manifests: Simpler for small teams but lacks continuous reconciliation and drift detection.

Trade-offs

- ArgoCD provides a rich UI, health assessment, and application-level rollbacks out of the box; operational overhead is moderate.
- FluxCD is lighter-weight and integrates well with Kubernetes but its UX for manual operations is less mature.
- A CI-based CD approach reduces additional runtime components but increases risk of configuration drift and lacks reconciliation.

Status

Accepted
